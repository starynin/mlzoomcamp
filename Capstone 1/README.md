I am interested in Predictive Maintenance. In this project I've made a Deep Learning model pretending predictive maintenance based on Thermal Images from cameras around the equipment. ‘Pretending” because I didn’t find enough thermal images. So, I took a dataset of weather images with clouds, rain, sunshine, sunrise pictures (4 categories) to fit the model, because they are the most similar to thermal images amid open datasets I could find.
